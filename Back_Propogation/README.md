# Back propagation algorithm using Python Numpy stack.

- This code is written for binary classification using ANN with Back Propagation.
- The network is implemented for only one data point with either 0 or 1 as the output class.
- The network uses one hidden layer with 2 hidden nodes using Sigmoid activation.
- The optimization happens according to back propagation algorithm.
